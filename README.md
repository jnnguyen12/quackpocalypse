# quackpocalypse

* You are playing as a duck, move with WASD and shoot with arrow keys

* Enemies have a chance to drop a power-up and if you touch them you can temporarily shoot in all directions

* You have three chances to be touched by enemies, and you die (and you get berated by a basic HTML screen)
